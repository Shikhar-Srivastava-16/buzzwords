These are the same Senate Democrats who lectured the base for years about the importance of preserving the filibuster so it would still be available when Democrats were in the minority
Among the material devastation to everyday people, Senate Dems have now blown a hole in their ability to work with the House.

We had an agreed upon plan, House took immense risk, then Senate turned around midway and destroyed it w/ a fear-based, inexplicable abdication.

They own what happens next.
Cool so what happens if GOP attach a national abortion ban to a CR? You'll vote for that too?

🚮
Extraordinary moment — Nancy Pelosi issues a statement calling on Democratic senators to reject the House funding bill, i.e. to defy Chuck Schumer.

"Democratic senators should listen to the women," she says, referring to Murray/DeLauro who want a 1-month stopgap bill instead.
KEEP CALLING. PEEL OFF ALL DEM SENATORS YOU CAN.

☎️: (202) 224-3121

Tell them to vote NO on Cloture and NO on CR. Vote is pushed to after 1:15ish for now. Situation is fluid. 

The only public YES votes are Schumer and Fetterman. They need 7-8 total. KEEP CALLING.

Call retiring Senators too!
A YES on cloture is a YES for the bill.

Do not let anyone play games with you.
I think some in the Senate have convinced themselves that the backlash to folding will be limited to “the left” and therefore ignorable.

Those people are deeply and profoundly misreading the moment and the stakes.

Virtually every swing district House Dem walked the plank to vote NO for a reason.
AOC: It is almost unthinkable why Senate Democrats would vote to to hand the few pieces of leverage that we have away for free when we've been sent here to protect social security, protect medicaid, and protect medicare.
New Yorkers: Call Sen. Gillibrand’s office to vote NO on cloture and NO on the Republican Spending Bill.

They vote in the morning.
☎️: (202) 224-4451
I’ll be on CNN at 6 with @jaketapper.bsky.social to discuss Senate Democrats’ responsibility to protect the federal government and vote NO on cloture and the GOP spending bill
the tesla protest might objectively be among the most successful in history already just in terms of immediate response, if you consider they forced the world’s most powerful person & its most wealthy to fully degrade themselves like used car salesmen on live TV while the whole world watched agog.
CALLS ARE WORKING - it has bought us precious time, but we NEED to keep the pressure up.

Tomorrow is the cloture vote.

KEEP CALLING: (202) 224-3121 ☎️☎️☎️

Tell your Dem Senator to vote NO on Cloture and NO on the Republican spending bill.

Do NOT assume your Senator will be good on this. Trust me.
It should be very clear to every Senate Democrat that any vote for Cloture will also be considered a vote for the bill.

People aren’t going to be tricked with procedural games.

They know exactly what is going on.

Defend Medicaid.
Vote NO on Cloture.
NO on bill.
🚨 Everyone needs to call their Dem Senator right now. They are starting to cave.

Tell them:
1. Vote NO on Cloture 
AND
2. Vote NO on the Republican spending bill.

Don’t let them pivot to reconciliation. GOP doesn’t need Dem votes on that and they know it.

TODAY is the showdown.
🤳🏽: (202) 224-3121
AOC: It's really because Republicans— they’re very thin skinned and they're very sensitive, and their feelings are very easily hurt. And so they have to vote on censure resolutions.
Trump backed GOP into a big corner with his “balanced budget” point.

The ONLY way House GOP could even think about upholding their “no cuts to Medicaid” swing seat promises and their spending cut mandates is deficit spending and bad math.

Now they have to gut Medicaid & hand it to Elon in public.
This list is so long and taking up so much real estate in his speech it’s almost like they want to distract from their massive cuts to Medicaid
Protect your peace.
Trump whining that Democrats wouldn't applaud him even if he cured a disease and then a second later bragging about withdrawing from the World Health Organization
Yeah thanking the Supreme Court for his excesses may not have the effect he hopes for.
He usually tries to at least open with broad vague lines that are “hard” to not clap for. He’s not even trying this time around.
Put your Joint Address questions here and I’ll see if I can answer some as I go ⬇️
when Elon Musk started recruiting for DOGE last November, he said the work would be “tedious” and “compensation is zero"

now it turns out some DOGE operatives are earning six-figure salaries, one as high as $195,200, as much as a civil servant can legally make

SOTU seats are not assigned. There are general seating areas for each body (House, Senate, SCOTUS,etc) but there are honored seats for each party’s leadership and they’re even trying to squat those.

If it doesn’t sort out, be aware you may see applause on both sides of the aisle but they may be GOP
Already hearing that Republican members have been showing up to the House floor trying to take up the Dem side seats for the joint address 💀
I’m not going to the Joint Address. I will be live posting and chatting with you all here instead. Then going on IG Live after.
If you were in Congress, what would you do for the State of the Union? What do you think Dems should do?
🔥 @aoc.bsky.social : “The numbers don’t add up. $880 BILLION is a devastating cut to Medicaid, and an attack on Medicare. Anyone who votes for this budget is voting to cut Medicaid and gut health care for Medicare recipients in 🇺🇸.”

Full: www.instagram.com/reel/DGg7cr0...
This vote was to start the process of the cuts. It WILL come back for a final vote.

There are some chances to slow or potentially stop it. Need constant pressure on GOP

Focus on GOP swing seats & key committees. Energy & Commerce is where the Medicaid fight will go down. Ways&Means for tax fight.
Elon Musk and his 19-year-olds have now disrupted the approval of medical devices that save lives.

Every member of Congress bears a responsibility to stop this right now.
Also if you feel strongly about Eric Adams, you should call your city councilmember to express that and ask for their position.

You’d be surprised. Hochul’s stance is highly disappointing but it doesn’t come from nowhere. Press all your electeds. City elections are in 5 months. Ask candidates too.
It may not be cool or hip in some circles, but we legitimately do need a massive amount of people to run for office.

Flood the school boards, councils, county seats, state legislatures, Congress, etc. 

Big changes at the top happen when the ground shifts at the bottom. And that can start now.
This is how it’s done.
Medicaid is not for sale.
NASA is not for sale.
The Post Office is not for sale.
America is not for sale.

We have an obligation to resist kings. We outnumber them. And they can be overwhelmed.
There are moments in these deportation fights when I can just FEEL how pissed off they are that I’m Puerto Rican 😂 they want to threaten me with it so bad 😂
🗣️ @aoc.bsky.social out fighting for the people & federal workers: “Every day our job is to wake up and say ‘what can I do today?’ — There is no act too small. Every action matters.” 🇺🇸

What a shame. Teamsters deserve better than this.
Jim Acosta: I think the AP should consider whether or not to sue the administration… and the rest of the press corps should start seriously considering whether it’s worth sending everyone into the Oval Office, onto Air Force One, or into the briefing room.
Go ahead.

Let the people see you for what you are.
This is why you fight these cowards.

The moment you stand up to them, they crumble.

Homan has nothing. The Fourth Amendment is clear and I am well within my duties to educate people of their rights.

He can threaten me with jail and call names all he wants. He’s got nothing else.
Pt. 2/2 ⬇️
It is perfectly legal to know your rights and to educate others about them, too.

EVERYONE in the United States, citizen or not, has rights. I will not allow this administration to intimidate us from helping you know about them.

Here’s our shareable guide ⬇️: (pt. 1/2)
“MaYbe shE’s goiNg to be in TroUble nOw”

Maybe he can learn to read. The Constitution would be a good place to start
Adams must be removed. The city cannot sustain being governed for nearly a year by a Mayor who is being coerced by Trump admin in order to escape charges. 

This corruption poses a real threat to the people of the city. He should have resigned a while ago, but will not. So it’s time for him to go.
Hell yeah. Hold the line. This is what we need people to do.

Slow things down, don’t comply in advance so the courts have time to stop them. It’s starting to work.
The Treasury Department right now. People are turning out against Musk and DOGE staging a takeover of the Treasury’s payment system. This crowd is big. The whole block is packed. “Lock him up,” everyone yells.

Just went live to talk about what is happening, what we can do, and what to expect this week: www.instagram.com/reel/DForuR_...
pushback works, part infinity:

apnews.com/article/immi...
Yes. While there are absolutely things Democrats can and must do to slow, obstruct, etc, GOP hold both House and Senate majorities, severely limiting our options. 

Johnson and Thune are handing over the own keys and relinquishing their own power. Even for the cynics this should be a shock.
this is what we want to see. tariff the shit out of elon’s companies www.businesstoday.in/world/canada...
Idgaf I’m still fighting for guaranteed healthcare. 

Aspiration is the answer. Not just “we’re not the bad guys.” 

We need something more meaningful than that. I want a future worth fighting for. They have no vision. We do. Lean into our strengths and knock them out. 👊🏽
I honestly believe our most powerful position in a toxic time that feeds on cynicism, apathy,& despair is to genuinely care and act for a better world.

Cynicism is our enemy. We should check it, incl. on the left. It’s not intellectually superior. It’s the virus they’re trying to infect us with. NO
i think it is important to say that the open and explicit racism of the president and the vice president isn’t just uncouth or “controversial” but a direct attack on tens of millions of americans and a dereliction of their duty to represent the entire country
Lessons to be learned: 

1. Centrists align with far-right to look tough on immigration
2. Centrists gain nothing
3. Far-right wins more power
If you are a federal worker being offered a buyout, I would advise against taking it.

Of course, this is a personal decision for everyone and it’s your choice.

But these offers are a rush job. The legality is questionable and this admin does not keep to its word.

They aren’t firing for a reason.
Thank you, I’ll have plenty! I used to crochet a long time ago and just started knitting a few weeks ago.

It’s been a great way to stop doomscrolling and reflect 😌

I’ve finished a Sophie scarf and have started a sweater. (I’m waiting for more purple yarn & am casting on a new cardigan as I wait 🫣)
It’s important to know that a lot of productive activity is happening in person and offline, too.

Not all of it can be broadcast online, but we’ve had hundreds of people showing up to our trainings, mobilizations, and more.

Keep going. Tyranny is eroded by a sea of small acts. Everything matters.
Yes, this administration is dangerous and cruel, but they are also shockingly dim and incompetent.

Opportunities are everywhere. 

Make everything as hard as possible. Resist every demand. Refuse entry without a warrant. Don’t take the buyout. Their problem solving skills are 📉
Community is the antidote to despair. 

Happy to host! 🌹
Focus on 1 or 2 things. Go deep on those. Focus on "news" about those things first and foremost. Think about the concrete actions you can take to impact those ONE or TWO things.
The price of eggs in the US is spiking, mostly due to #H5N1 bird flu. Solving the problem requires urgent, important communications from the CDC & FDA* and rapid development of research by the NIH**

Had an awesome time chatting with Jon Stewart & @weeklyshowpodcast.bsky.social talking about how to fight the dumpster fire. 

Gear up. It’s time to brawl.
The folks obsessively posting about egg prices for the past few years have gone strangely quiet just as egg prices hit an all-time high.
One thing about me is that I will fight Nazis until I’m six feet in the ground.
Rep AOC: "republicans, who have voted consistently against the violence against women's act, who have taken the rights of all women to have control over their own body, who as women are bleeding out in parking lots, now want to pretend today that they care about women."
AOC: Trans girls are girls. And for all the folks that are so concerned, thank you for your concern for women for the first time. I don't know who has been to gym class,  I’ve played co-ed sports all the time
AOC has raised over $90,000 in the past 24 hours for those impacted by the LA wildfires.

Hmm can we workshop the name please? They’re going to be bullied by the skibidi kids
Recently took a peek at Twitter and the disinformation is getting substantially more dangerous. Someone could get killed.

The tactics of constantly repeating outright lies, targeting specific people, repurposing years-old footage and presenting them as new is getting to another level. It’s scary.
AOC: “Oh, I don’t think we’re witnessing the START of an oligarchy. I think we are fully here.” 🇺🇸
You know it’s bad when even Trump is pity posting through it 💀
Tried my best. Sorry I couldn’t pull it through everyone - we live to fight another day. ♥️
WE ARE STILL IN THIS. 
Wipe your tears.
This is the difficult business of hope and defying expectation.
We do not give up.
We run through the tape.

Y’all aren’t allowed to throw in the towel until I do. 😉

Big breath. Locked in. Let’s do this.
We can do this. Tomorrow is the day. Do not give up early. Do not be discouraged! A close vote is what we needed here and that’s what we got.

Stay POSITIVE and PRAYERFUL and I will be working.
STAY POSITIVE!
If you’re able, please send some prayers and positivity our way for today and tomorrow please 🙏🏽 Gracias!
Don't assume maximalist outcomes for the Trump administration. That's a form of psychological surrender. We should attempt to exploit every stumble, failure, and misstep, and there will be stumbles, failures, and missteps.
They’re planning a heist in plain sight.
I’m excited for @gregcasar.bsky.social’s leadership at the Progressive Caucus. He’s going to be great.
Last night, I spoke with Amnesty International's executive director about their new report on Israel's war in Gaza and its conclusion that Israel is committing genocide.

AOC: This brings me to Hanlon's razor which is to not ascribe to malice what can be more easily attributed to stupidity
Sometimes the combination of arrogance and ignorance is breathtaking. Yes, US health care has high admin costs; that's because it relies so much on private insurers. Govt-run health insurance has much lower overhead
the frenzy over the hunter biden pardon is a good reminder that the press knows how to make something a scandal and has decided that nothing trump does is truly deserving of that treatment
Call me crazy, but I think Justin Sun, a Chinese national being prosecuted for fraud by the SEC, sending Trump $18 million should be a bigger story

The direct enrichment of Trump by a foreign national weeks before he takes office has merited no coverage in the NYT or Washington Post
"Repeat after me: there was no 'landslide'. There was no 'blowout'. There was no 'sweeping' mandate given to Trump by the electorate. The numbers don’t lie."

My new Guardian op-ed on the new GOP election lie - and  why it's important to rebut it! I brought (lots of) receipts:
“Don’t feed the trolls” also extends to bad opinion pieces in papers of record.

They run them bc people react to them the most.

If we stop linking to bad columns and instead post thinkers we find valuable (& generate convo around it), incentives change.

It’s not easy and takes constant practice!
Did anyone else first see this on Clarissa Explains It All and pined over it the rest of their childhood
People adapt to fascism. That's what you learn when you read history. And it's easy for those who are not its direct targets to do.
These losers do this because their only shot at companionship is a hostage situation, so they spend all day harassing people into thinking a woman’s self worth should resemble their own.

If they tried being kind and not approaching every relationship as a transaction, they would be much happier
Let’s start a Baja Blast happy hour. First of every month - today can run through the 2nd.

Cocktail and mocktail recipes + photos welcome 🚀
And ironically the articles chastising people to stay on Twitter won’t even circulate on there or Meta because they both suppress links to journalism! 😂
People are leaving Twitter because it’s not fun anymore and no one is obligated to be on a platform they don’t enjoy.

It’s not rocket science.
there will be more articles written next week about the threat of “cancel culture” than there will be about this
Fun fact: there’s never been a Democratic director of the FBI in its entire history.
Many are reckoning w the role Elon played in the election & how he artificially manipulated X’s algorithm for his purposes. There is real concern about legitimizing misinfo w/ their presence.

Of course, there ARE people there, and that is not easily dismissed.

But talks of a larger switch are real
And where reputable journalists and thinkers go, so do elected officials.

I’ve been getting asked lately about a more serious + systemic migration to Bluesky among electeds.

Idk the answer but it highlights how much of a breaking point misinfo & throttling has become for Twitter(& other platforms)
Oh look! It’s a gallery of things I must now order online because it takes 20 minutes to find the Keeper of the Deodorant Key
I am such a believer in this. Down-ballot is the way.

It’s also how we build a sustainable future of good leaders and infrastructure to elect and support them, as well as the movements they represent.

We don’t just need strong candidates. We need strong organizers, managers, CoS, grassroots, etc.
Show me a picture on your phone that has your energy that isn’t a selfie.
It is hard to counter this combo of cynicism and lying without bonafide candidates who can throw a punch.

If we want to beat a right wing that weaponizes (justified!) public anger at Big Pharma to destroy the social safety net + spread conspiracies, we can’t run Dems who take money from Big Pharma.
Some say the results of the election disprove that, but I think if you sit w the specific messages the opposition leaned into and what people heard, it is worth examining.

The RFK Jr / MAHA thing did resonate w/people. Naming big pharma, big ag, etc.

They’re a lying mess, but the words were there
One reason it isn’t discussed more is bc lots of money and influence relies on pressuring electeds into taking corporate money and rejecting/reversing these no-lobbyist $ pledges.

I know members who went back on their promise and later lost seats to GOP. Voters want ppl who stand up to corruption
In 2018 Dems elected the largest class to Congress since Watergate, ~60 seats.

A lot of it was, yes, Trump backlash. But the winners also had another thing in common, despite a wide range of differences: most rejected corporate PAC money.

It’s a hugely compelling factor to voters & underdiscussed
Signal alone is not enough. If you are an activist, you need a complete self-defense against surveillance. @eff.org has been maintaining these resources for years: ssd.eff.org
Good. It’s horrific how other platforms abused their reach to strangle local, independent, and national outlets alike.

I WANT to see news and actual vetted work and I WANT journalists to get rewarded for it. 

Because I want to live in a thinking human world over some AI generated slop dystopia

What are some accessible Infosec & Opsec resources that activists, journalists, and organizers can turn to in preparation for the Trump admin?

Preparing for a fascist regime can feel scary and paralyzing. This seems like an area where people can take control w/ concrete steps.

Please share below 👇🏽
going to keep saying: it's important for basic functioning for a society to discourage baldfaced lying
The Meta thing is interesting because users have been vocally opposed to all these tweaks along the way & they have defended each one w/ metrics+engagement.

But when there’s competition, people are moving.

It’s a reminder that engagement ≠ enjoyment. Wonder what experts have to say about this ⬇️
Happy Thanksgiving week, everyone. We’ve been spending the last few days addressing food insecurity across NYC.

Shout out to our supporters, small-dollar contributors, and volunteers who make all this happen and help us support similar efforts across the country.

I am really grateful. ♥️ Thank you
Very interesting that crypto and AIPAC seemed to collaborate on so many races!

perfectunion.us/investigatio...
Know 👏🏽 your 👏🏽 worth! 👏🏽
The other exploding area of dark money in politics is the crypto lobby.

They have dumped insane sums in elections in both parties (Dem primaries + GOP general elections).

It’s pretty bad
Really excited to listen to the new Kendrick album.

I’m waiting until I have the space and attention to listen to it all the way through uninterrupted, and give it the respect it deserves. Hopefully tomorrow
This is entirely true. A lot of the high value posters have moved here, people who intelligently discuss important topics, report on news that major media outlets are often so slow on, and whats more... the trolls, hate comments, and slurs are a tiny fraction of what they are on Elon's twitter.
I could not sit silent while an elected official who spreads hate & lies that are getting trans people killed pretends to care about the future of the Internet. So I spoke up during Rep Nancy Mace's speech at the Project Liberty Summit & I would do it again www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2024-11...
I agree on the centrist point and frankly there are a lot of people out there who are just saying what they need to say to cover their ass and cash a check. It sucks.

The Cheney thing is a clear example of a bad idea that the people who pushed it won’t take responsibility for. They need to
AIPAC went after less targets than they suggested they would. And some of our strongest pickups in PA, IL survived. I think that’s worth exploring.

Reflection doesn’t automatically mean capitulation or left-punching. It can mean actively identifying the strategies that are actually *working,* too.
This is not to suggest we shouldn’t take these stances. We do!

But it is to say the opposite - we have a responsibility to take stances that protect human life AND grow their power, too. Not settle for keeping them in obscurity or the margins forever as oppression takes the day.
The progressive left had a very difficult year electorally.

We lost several very strong seats in Congress - some of the only voices that stood for Palestinians. Didn’t pick up much.

We can reflexively blame others/the system or we can re-tool, look inward, figure out where to build and go next.
Like one bee’s nest I’ve been thinking about electorally is how we cannot make the case that if an elected takes X position (ex. embargo) it will deliver voters if the left isn’t yet able to successfully turn out for pols who do.

The organizing, resources, etc needs to back up the rhetoric to win
They have their own TV channels, personalities, media. They deride fact checking and (well) moderated debate. They buy social media platforms to manipulate algorithms and amplify content that suits their preferred ends and worldview.

What they are threatened by are places of alignment + organizing
One thing I find interesting about the echo chamber complaint is that an echo chamber just won a presidential election.

Put aside the convo of whether it’s “good” or “bad” for a moment. The far right has devoted enormous resources + time to building echo chambers & loathes spaces they don’t control
There have been a lot of times where I feel like we need to have honest discussions on the left about what has worked and what hasn’t, share observations without judgement, but it feels like there isn’t much space for it. I think it’s holding us back.

I wonder how and where we can accomplish that.
Can people share their funny people starter packs/follow recs?

Need to dial in the heehee to haha ratio in my fyp
We need a real organizer and machine builder. Laser focused.

Yes, fundraising is crucial, but we need someone who can build the infrastructure for resources to be deployed effectively.

I want someone with a record of knowing how to WIN with working people and preserving our values. They exist!
H.R. 9494, the attack on non-profits bill, has passed the house.

But it went from being supported by 52 Dems to just 15.

Time to get on your Senator's case and halt the bill there.
A lot of people are shocked by the “points on the board” phrase - as was I - but it was also shocking how common I heard this and other game-type metaphors.

Many who are deeply disconnected from the harm do view and talk about it privately as a kind of sport. It is gross 🤢
The culture here makes it possible.

After Jan 6th I privately confronted Mace for lying about my story bc she too was terrified in her office.

I said as another assault survivor you know how harmful what you did is. Why? She said “whatever you know it’s a game, just points on the board”

Uhh no???
Fwiw she is pretty widely disliked even by her GOP colleagues. She’s all over the place. Messy. Fights with them too.

This is the most attention she has gotten in ages despite her many attempts, hence the differences in tack some have taken in this whole brouhaha. She really craves it. It’s weird
Like Skype to Zoom
Perhaps it’s not the most riveting answer but Sanitation issues are a big one. Landlord issues is maybe number 2.

Your city councilperson can do a lot! Like when they were rolling out the rat bins in NYC, sometimes areas that got them came down to those who asked! Good rep + ppl speaking up matters

Thank you for this leadership.

One thing I’ve seen is that while many people seek digital spaces for conversations, it’s also an easy place to speak in ways we never would in person.

We can’t afford to turn on one another. We must practice (big!) disagreement while remaining a community. Thank you
"If a woman doesn't look woman enough to a Republican, they want to be able to inspect your genitals to use a bathroom? It's disgusting.

Everyone should reject it completely... they're endangering women, they're endangering girls of all kind, and everyone should reject it. It's gross." - AOC
Are drafts a thing here yet
Stating the obvious here but if this report cleared Gaetz’s name, they’d eagerly release it in the name of “transparency”
Team Call Them Skeets reporting for duty 🫡
lol. lmao
A lot of people responsible for poor decisions are on a press tour right now because if they didn’t, people would rightfully be questioning THEIR leadership and they know it.

It’s weak even by normal left-punching standards. Zero evidence more Liz Cheney would have won this. The opposite, actually.
In comparison, a similar bill was brought up before the House earlier this year. There was much less organizing against it and it got further then.

Today’s vote was a very different story. The attention + organizing played a role.

If you can thank your rep for voting NO, please do so. It matters.
Was there today for the H.R. 9495 vote (bill that would have allowed labeling nonprofits as terrorist supporting organizations).

Voted no, of course - but I do want to report that the activism DID work and persuaded members.

I thought it’d be a lonely NO vote, which we take often. It wasn’t.
The macro conditions matter. Sometimes you run the best possible campaign and still come up short.

But in a sea of hot takes, we should be prioritizing listening to leaders who had a solid ship. We still may have disagreements, but at least we know their operation was solid & come from that place
Yes yes yes. I have run a 24/7, 365 operation since I got elected. I have a permanent campaign HQ that rotates between off-year and on-year organizing.

People thought it was nuts when I first set it up. I said you’re setting yourself up for disaster if you only show up 6 mos before an election.
I wish people were made to show receipts of their operations before casting blame.

How many doors did your team knock this cycle? This should be asked more.

Also a LOT of consultants get rich off Dem campaigns win/lose so there’s a huge financial incentive to blame others so they stay on payroll
I’m one of the few Dems in NYC who even RUNS a general election campaign, and the only one who ran a robust field op. We ran ahead of top of the ticket.

Excellence matters. A lot of folks w/ poor campaign fundamentals are now blaming “wokism” but haven’t held a town hall or knocked a door all cycle
The ironic thing about post election chatter is that a lot of the time it’s candidates who lost, underperformed, or underworked who have endless time to go on TV and share their blame story.

And for their part, journalists rarely EVER ask if that person actually ran a functionally solid campaign
Earnest post, but: a thing I like here is it’s okay to have moments of happiness in public without being broadly scolded, and I believe that sustaining this kind of humanity will be very important as we resist fascism.

We have to sustain each other. Making joy isn’t denial, it’s how we will survive
I’m gonna wait for now
Thank you for the tip!

Just turned it on 👍🏽
Should I tell Twitter I’m here? I don’t want to inadvertently cause an influx of all the worst accounts on the internet.

Does anyone else feel like they had to rebuild their wardrobe after it turned into all sweats/work clothes during COVID and if so how did you go about doing that?
the most interesting part of the story so far imo is how much corruption at the Court has been exposed with a relatively small amount of effort
I like it here and I don’t think a mega corp Twitter clone can kill spaces like these.

There is a high level of original thought and engagement, people care about each other and maintain a strong space minimizing bad faith, harassment, and disinfo, which lets people be themselves & build community
Just took a week off and I too get the Sunday scaries, AMA
Honoring autocrats is not “subtlety” or “sophistication,” whatever the Biden admin may say. It sells out human rights advocates, dispirits our democratic allies, strengthens our enemies. Modi should be a pariah.
People should dance way more. Just let loose. Things get too uptight otherwise
Don’t agonize, orcanize  🐳
I find utopian science fiction (which, despite the conflicts in Star Trek I’d still say is more utopian than not) to be way more fascinating than dystopian.

It can be easy to whip up stories of a bad future. It takes real imagination & effort to imagine how an advanced ethical society could succeed
Star Trek has always been a show of deep political and social commentary, both in its content and production.

It featured the first interracial kiss on TV.

Uhura was one of the most progressive black characters on TV at the time. When she wanted to leave, MLK wrote to her to convince her to stay
Ok! Did you know that the character of Spock & the Vulcan “live long and prosper” 🖖🏽 is actually drawn from the Torah & informed by Nimoy’s Jewish heritage?

As a child, Nimoy was in synagogue & snuck a look at the Konahim blessing 🖖🏽. ST centered pluralistic society & he made it part of his character
As for the UFO/UAP thing, idk. The Oversight chairman told the press we’re going to have a hearing about it, but we haven’t heard anything about that on the member end.

Traditionally, UAP hearings/matters have been handled by the Intel committee
Janeway. I grew up on TNG, TOS,& VOY, but the strong women characters on Voyager changed my life as a kid. I don’t know if I’d be in Congress if that show wasn’t on TV.

My dad was a huge Star Trek/Roddenberry fan & always talked about its social & political history. I could go on forever about ST 🪐

Honestly having a really strong understanding of your walk-away point & what you’re willing to accept or not (and sticking to it!) is so helpful.

A lot of situations/people will push to see how little you’ll accept, but they can & will accommodate more. Happens in politics all the time but life too
Been playing Zelda for weeks and just now found the autobuilder 🙃
Right now many of these folks are sending up test balloons - Trump’s use of AI in the DeSantis video, Musk’s censorship in Turkey for the election.

All of it is precedent-setting and testing waters ahead of ‘24. It will get worse. Q is how to respond when gov overall won’t, or may not in time
Really wondering about where the line is to leave the other place. I am concerned about next year’s election given Musk putting his finger on the scale in Turkey, etc. 

There is a line where the harm of unchecked disinfo exceeds the benefits of direct, authentic communication.

It’s really sad
Mariame Kaba has taught me a lot of things. One thing she taught me is to be skeptical of thinking nothing has changed. Because things are constantly changing and so we can push. Like she says in this interview. https://theintercept.com/2021/03/17/intercepted-mariame-kaba-abolitionist-organizing/

People who are night owls in a morning lark world, what do you do / how do you adapt
And actually, you can get away with beers & well drinks for a while if your spot has a great vibe than if you have a bad vibe but make fancy cocktails.

(The bird app is trying to do the latter right now btw with all the new feature rollouts)

I’ve used this a lot in political organizing as well
Social media, and any place where community gathers, are sites of hospitality. You have to treat them as such.

This requires platforms to have high social EQ as much as it does technical skill and product. Just as being a great bar requires curating  a great vibe as well as serving great drinks.
This applies to so many areas and industries, but where I think a lot of digital spaces find difficulty is in recognizing they are also serving as hosts in a traditional social sense.

And good hosts don’t let people do whatever (shout out to the book Art of Gathering which talks about this so well)
I learned a LOT about organizing and community from working in hospitality.

1. If you have 40 people who come to your spot and 1 disruptive jerk & don’t do anything, the 40 won’t come back

2. You need to maintain a fun and welcoming atmosphere even if you have regulars, that’s what helps you grow
One of the under-appreciated roles of bartenders is that it‘s literally their job to cultivate strong community.

Regulars keep a place in business. The best bartenders curate a strong vibe that draws solid people in, who then form a community that gathers at your spot.

Someone suggested I stream playing Zelda but yesterday it took me 10 minutes to make a car, I died shortly thereafter, and spent another 10 minutes making the same car
For me it was pretty seasonal. I like to make drinks with the weather! I ran a taco bar so a lot of tequila and mezcal based drinks. During the winter I like to lean on bourbons & other whiskeys. I do mocktails too.

I still make cocktails for friends & family, it’s such a treat to do for them 🍹
McCarthy is just not that girl and people treating him like he is are making the situation worse.

At this point I feel like it’s not even Trump at the center of the story here, it’s CNN.

We know what this guy is going to do. The choice to let it happen without any meaningful plan (and simply leaving a moderator to “push back” is absolutely *not* a plan) is what deserves attention here.
I was expecting it to be bad and somehow it was worse.

CNN gave free reign to election disinformation, platformed attacks on a sexual assault victim on national television, hosted defenses of Jan 6th and dangerous lies about abortion in front of an audience preselected to cheer at all of it.

If you read any FBI or DOJ report on violent extremism in the United States, right-wing extremism and white supremacy movements are far and away the single largest driver of political violence and domestic terror.

And that’s even w/ the problematic history of those agencies & grassroots left mvmts
People love to act like centrists are the sober adults in the room, but  they really will be out here both-sidesing insurrectionists.

A lot of this has to do with climate inequality. Wealthy people are less impacted  by climate change (or can more easily bounce back from consequences) and so they don't need to be aware of risk. This is why we always call for climate justice.

Another impact of the downfall of Twitter / FB is the fragmentation of media.

I’ve been in the crucible enough times to develop an instinct for what resonance feels like (even if it’s not in your favor). You can tell it’s so off.

They have broken the infrastructure for 2 way conversation. It’s just one-way communication and pile ons now. Billboards and crashes. A real shame.
One thing about the bird app’s platform getting totally gamed and manipulated is that where it once was a place for people and decisionmakers to actually try to follow public conversation, it now no longer has that value. 

The metrics and engagement are very contrived now.It’s basic purpose is gone

We do! You can now call your hospital and ask for an **itemized** medical bill. Many people report seeing their bills drop after doing this.

About half of all medical bills are estimated to have errors, and those errors often make things more expensive for patients - not less.

Ironically, we’ve been through the mass media wringer so many times, their antics don’t hit the same.

Sadly I can’t tell you how many pols are scared of a bad headline, let alone a media cycle.

But you overcome it, withstanding that can be a superpower. I’ve never regretted acting w/ my conviction
We’re getting so many screaming people (not from NYC) calling my office bc of my stance on Jordan Neely that our phones got overloaded.

This happens when we get attacked by outlets like Fox.

It’s also how a lot of politicians get scared into not saying anything, equivocating, or changing positions
i talk to people I disagree with constantly 

I do not talk to people who disagree with me on things like “basic human rights”

I find this distinction to be very easy to understand
Jordan Neely’s last words were about how jail was easier than a city starved of a safety net w/extortionate costs of living.

And leaders can’t say whether killing him was wrong or not.

Why? Because he was hungry and told the truth? They’ve given 0 explanation as to what makes this so “complicated”
I’ve seen a lot of awful things as an elected official. But this honestly feels like a new low.
I cannot even begin to state how much of a profound failure of leadership we have seen in the last 24h re: Jordan Neely.

Virtually every one of us is closer to being in Neely’s shoes than we think. How could any leader struggle to condemn violence? Being poor or sick is not a license to be killed
If people are talking about Alf now then Garbage Pail Kids is just around the corner
There is a procedural trick in the House known as a discharge petition.

If I had to buy one product only that was fancier and do everything else drugstore, it would be upgrading my complexion product first (foundation/tinted moisturizer/whatever you put on your face/etc)

That’s one thing that I find actually has an impact on the quality of my skin
My contribution today is that a lot of makeup/skincare marketing tricks you into thinking you need to have fanciest versions of everything. You really don’t! So many amazing, actual MUAs on set use drugstore.

That said if you do want to splurge it’s good to know what types are worth “upgrading” 1st

A lot of what happened in Twitter was the right claiming they had disproportionate suspensions & bans due to “political bias.”

From the research, there’s no evidence for that. Accts were banned for breaking the rules. But the right’s “working the refs”got platforms to skew their algos to boost them
A core element of right wing harassment campaigns is politicizing parts of community culture in order to “work the refs” into making a place more dangerous. They do this to media as well.

Ex: they cast not harassing people as a “leftist value” and then claim political persecution when banned for it
Both. The invite tree accountability makes people more judicious about bringing in solid people, the early suspensions of bad accounts increased trust/confidence about commitment to safety, and the smaller community feels safer too.

I do get nervous for #s going up & harassment campaigns starting
This is what happens when a platform feels safer and more fun!

Endless solidarity with the writers at WGA. Make the bosses pay!!
Between the WGA strike, the Teamsters negotiating a new contract with UPS and UAW’s contract with the Big 3 automakers expiring, this year could be an enormous, historic opportunity for strikes and building working class power.
Can someone who is familiar w/ the strike give advice to people that occasionally appear on TV so we don’t accidentally cross a picket line?

How should we respond to requests for interviews? Is it all TV, most/some, etc? Decline everything?

Sorry this is niche but advice appreciated! Solidarity ✊🏽🪧
Yes. We pushed for it to be included in HR1. A lot of Dems pushed back. If you want to know what your member thinks about it, you need to ask them specifically.

The best time to get a candidate to commit to a position is during a primary. Especially if it’s their first one or a competitive one

It sure does seem that way doesn’t it.
Absolutely not normal.
Yes Jasmine!! 👏
Bribes. They’re known as bribes.
Trump’s latest tariffs have sent the stock market tumbling and triggered warnings from economists about rising costs on everyday goods. So why is Trump willing to impose such chaos on both us and our allies? Is there a method to Trump's tariff madness? The Big Picture digs into the truth today.
Exactly.
Not without Democratic help you won’t.
Anyone? Bueller?
New Canadian tourism ad just dropped.

Pete Buttigieg is on point, as ever.
They can’t pretend they’re suddenly for cancer research just because they brought a kid to Congress. Sheesh.
Does she hear herself...
Tell 'em, Mayor Wu!
Get him Pete!!
Ah. Such easy times they once were.
Of course... Here we go again...
She stuffed him in a locker with this.
That about describes it, yes.
She is the voice we need!
Just when you think they can’t like or respect us any less…
He has sold his soul to Trump.
In tomorrow's piece, Jay Kuo asks what the endgame is of Trump's tariff tear against Mexico and Canada. Is it an attempt to further encroach on Congress' power? And yesterday, Todd Beeton set the stage for Donald's joint address before Congress. Don't miss either deep dive and read The Big Picture.
This is where we are, America.
Is she serious now? 🤦🏻‍♂️
Well, that speech by 47 last night was a complete shitshow, in case you were wondering. I hope and trust most of you didn’t watch, so I’ve distilled what matters and have thoughts about his presidency. Link to my write-up: buff.ly/C2wFI6E
Well said!
Remember: Musk is a coward at heart. A weak man, not a strong one. A fragile ego just like the guy he shares an office with.
What a creative roast 🔥
This is the way. Write your pension fund, school, city comptroller and demand divestment from Tesla.
So close... and yet...
She said under oath she wouldn’t politicize the Justice Department. She lied.
Are you nervous, Elon?
People nowadays.
I know because I’m old enough to have been there when they adopted it.
Perfectly said, Vivian.
Trump is taking the stage for his big speech tonight, but things aren’t as rosy as they were a few weeks ago. His approval ratings are slipping, his tariffs just sent the stock market tumbling, and Democrats are on the attack. So, what can we expect to see tonight? The Big Picture breaks it down.
Trump’s goal all along was to end military aid to Ukraine. That’s why he offered a “peace deal” with no security guarantees and set up that fight with President Zelenskyy knowing no sane leader would accept it.
After a rash of Republican town halls where MAGA lawmakers have been met with outraged constituents, Trump attempted to claim on Truth Social that the audiences have been made up of "paid troublemakers" that are secretly Democrats.
When America faltered, others stood up to lead.
Lying liar says what?
Anyone have that sinking feeling happening?
Military aid to Ukraine has always been a bargain for the U.S. 

We degraded Russia’s armed forces and replaced our own stockpiles with brand new weapons, all while brave Ukrainians— not Americans—fought the Russians off. 

Halting that aid is not only morally repulsive, it’s plain stupid.
Zuck and Muck. 🤢
Someone's mad...
We had just fought a war of independence with England after all.
I miss America’s Dad.
Lies, lies, lies.
And yet here we are, plunging cartoonishly downward already.
Tell em, Madam Secretary 🔥
Or Russian stooges!
The stuff of nightmares.
That went downhill quickly.
Our national shame knows no bounds under the Trumperate of Trump/Musk/Vance.
Macron is quite correct.
The Ukrainian President tweeted out a torrent of "thank you" messages to world leaders who offered support after his tense meeting with President Trump and Vice President Vance on Friday.
Same.
He said what he said.
Rep. Crockett is a treasure.
When Trump dubbed him “Little Marco,” he didn’t know how spot on the nickname would become. Rubio has now debased himself with 180s on Ukraine and other vital security issues, and I bring the receipts. Link to my write-up: buff.ly/IAuTXhh
MAGA trolling MAGA 😂
The House GOP’s budget resolution is more of a wish list than a done deal. But that doesn’t mean we can ignore it. Here’s where things stand and, most importantly, where public pressure can make a difference.

Such a tragic loss. Thinking of their families during this time.

Says it all.
The chaos of Trump's first month in office is no accident. This gutting of the federal government and impounding of Congressionally allocated funds was laid out years ago by Russell Vought, Trump's OMB director and Project 2025 architect. Todd Beeton looked at his core beliefs for The Big Picture.
Of course... 🤦
It’s so hard to connect the dots though.
So... who's going to tell him...

They said we were being hysterical for saying he would rule like a fascist.
This is so cruel.
What are we becoming?
The House GOP just passed a draconian budget resolution, but despite GOP misinformation, this is just a blueprint, not a final bill. That means there’s still time to push back against proposed Medicaid cuts and tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy. Here’s what you need to know. 👇

We have lost one of the true giants of the screen. Gene Hackman could play anyone, and you could feel a whole life behind it. He could be everyone and no one, a towering presence or an everyday Joe. That’s how powerful an actor he was. He will be missed, but his work will live on forever.
Really? 🙄
The perfect response 🔥
The BBC is quite correct.
In tomorrow’s piece, Jay Kuo will dive into the details of the GOP's recently adopted draconian budget resolution. And yesterday, Todd Beeton looked at budget director Russell Vought and explored the roots of his theory of an all-powerful president. Don't miss either piece from The Big Picture!

Let’s face it. Getting rid of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion is to make way for less qualified white men to take positions they don’t deserve.

Well this is awkward 😂
Donald Trump's budget director Russell Vought is the architect not just of Project 2025 but of the past 36 chaotic days of Trump 2.0. We need to dig into Vought's philosophy of "radical constitutionalism" and where it could lead the nation.
Pedro is the best ❤️

Just awful, Elon.
From Ukraine to Maine, defenders of democracy are standing up and speaking out. And the people are responding. My write-up on the state of the resistance: https://buff.ly/3ETGLVZ
The destruction is the point.
How does this make sense?
President Zelenskyy has more courage, principle and honor in his right pinky than Trump has displayed in his whole, vile lifetime.
Slava Ukraini! Glory to the heroes.
Feeling overwhelmed by Trump’s endless chaos? You’re not alone. But there’s a way to cut through the noise and make sense of it all.
I am deeply ashamed that the U.S. is not among these defenders of Ukraine but deeply grateful to the other nations of the world who have stood up to fill the void we have left.
Patel and Bongino in charge of the FBI is out of some MAGA fever dream. Villain and scoundrel, they are.
Let’s get something clear. The GOP has the power to keep the government from shutting down in March. They control both chambers of Congress and the White House. If they can’t reach a budget deal within their own ranks, that completely on them.

Dems: Don’t lift a finger to help them. Not one.
The more you know…
For Trump it was a joke by Obama.
How brave of Olivia.

Kudos to Gov. Janet Mills of Maine for standing up to Trump. He threatened loss of federal funds for her state simply because it allows trans girls to play in sports. She said, “See you in court.”

Trump is a weak, shallow, callous leader who wants desperately to be a despot. #BullyPolPot
Elon’s mass harassment email to all federal employees underscores the importance of having unions to represent workers against abusive management.

Elon Musk fancies himself some kind of maverick technologist superhero.

JD Vance's best-selling book "Hillbilly Elegy" is among the books the Department of Defense pulled from school shelves for review after Donald Trump's recent executive order.

Talk about Putin on airs.
It’s been a long first 30 days. And there’s been a lot of bad news lately. So how about some good news for a change? There’s a shift in public opinion over Trump’s aggressive moves. Check out the evidence in my piece today: https://buff.ly/4beyVCE
Talk about a rigged system.
The politics of spite are alive and well in Donald Trump's Washington. This compelling piece from The Big Picture explores how the MAGA Republican Party has transformed obstruction into an electoral strategy and what Democrats can do to counter this trend.
Hypocrite says what?
Basic biology eludes her.
How on-brand for MAGA 🙄
Maybe we should strand him in space for a long while, too.
Even MAGA can't keep up with Trump's lies.
Musk is so predictably petty.
DOGE = Department of Gross Errors
This is what true politicization of the DoJ looks like.
This is absolutely disgusting.
A grown man throwing a temper tantrum.
Trump isn’t going to end the war in Ukraine. He’s going to make it easier for Russia to keep what it stole and greenlight Putin to go after other countries.
“There’s too much going on. It’s overwhelming.” If that sounds familiar, this piece is for you. Jay Kuo breaks up Donald's latest power plays into three categories: bad, worse, and worst. It may sound heavy, but understanding them makes it easier to stay informed without feeling buried.
They're saying the quiet parts out loud now.
Turns out we “deranged” people simply saw the truth clearly.
I’ve seen several stories like this. They didn’t limit “probation” period firings to new hires.
As to be expected of MAGA snowflakes.
He’s really good at this!
It didn’t end well for the last king to try to rule America. Just sayin’.
More of this energy everywhere please!
So...... who's going to tell him....
You cast the net too widely, and you’re gonna drown in it yourself. JD Vance’s book Hillbilly Elegy is now on a list of books to be reviewed and possibly banned, per PEN America.
Nice try, snowflakes.
No one should be surprised. But it’s still appalling.
This is genius.
You had it right the first time.
No lie detected.
They surely are.
Timothy Snyder is an expert of modern authoritarianism.
Tomorrow, Jay Kuo will break down Trump’s power grab into three buckets, looking at how successful he’s been at each. Yesterday, Todd Beeton looked at how the entire MO of Trump and his followers has become simply to “own the libs” at every opportunity. Don't miss either piece at The Big Picture.
They did this with the federal workers overseeing our nuclear weapons stockpile, too. Starting to sense a pattern in this kakistocracy.
What a double standard.
Using our “global strength” to force an invaded country into concessions with an invader makes us complicit with the invader. It’s like returning an abuse victim to the abuser’s home. Shameful. Wrong. Un-American.

Everyone around him likes to feed his ego.
But but RFK Jr. promised he woudn’t do crazy things! Pinky swear and all!
Where did that come from! 😂
Trump's politics of spite are front and center in his second term. It's a virus that has spread to the entire Republican Party, making his presidency more about "owning the libs" than effecting any positive change. Todd Beeton dug into this mindset for The Big Picture.
Will their voters ever wake up to the fact that the GOP isn’t out to help them?
I’m George Takei and I approve of this message.
He’ll just keep crapping on everything good.
Trump blames Ukraine for starting the war the way a rapist blames his victim for looking too sexy.
Tell 'em AOC!!!
The sooner we collectively realize that Elon Musk is a shitposting, conspiracy-addled fool, who needs to stay out of public policy not upend it, the safer we’ll all be.
Listen up.
Very thankful everyone survived this harrowing incident.
They love to dish it but they can never take it.
Read this and try not to fume. Especially as you think of 47 wasting taxpayer money at the Super Bowl, Daytona and while playing golf half his presidency.
So... who's going to tell her?
Man who sold his soul says what?

Musk is full of shit as always.
DOGE has gained access to our Social Security system, and now Musk is spreading lies about massive fraud all so we greenlight his taking an ax to everything. I call out his B.S. in today’s piece: https://buff.ly/3X5uNPt

If you wanted to cut waste, fraud, and abuse, you would empower the inspectors general. 

If you wanted more waste, fraud, and abuse, you would fire them.

None of the broligarchs knows what they’re talking about. They’re just hot air, spewing what sounds smart to them but is actually a telltale sign of ignorance.
JFC indeed.
What do you think?
Resistance is brewing in Trump’s Department of Justice! When federal prosecutors were told to drop corruption charges against Eric Adams, they didn’t just back down, they resigned in protest. 👏 And it's not the only hurdle Trump has faced this week.
Oh myyy
Fragile ego, much?
That explains a lot.

Weird.

A critical point.
You cannot fire so many people and shutter so many agencies and services and not expect things to start to go very bad very quickly.

Our job is to highlight not only the chaos and cruelty of the firings, but also the devastating consequences. 

The public must turn on this madness and soon.
We are nearing a precipice.
He’s right again.

This is the way.
Resistance to Trump's despotism is growing...and it's working. Earlier this week, Team Big Picture talked with California’s Attorney General Rob Bonta about the important work he's doing to resist Trump in the courts.

Donald Trump’s nonstop barrage of unlawful orders is designed to confuse and overwhelm us. But that doesn’t mean the administration has a clear plan for how to actually get things done. Jay Kuo broke down the administration's cat-and-mouse game for The Big Picture.

The big question was whether the White House would obey court orders and appeal them as is its right, or whether it would thumb its nose and risk contempt. The White House so far has chosen to appeal.

Trump's first weeks in office have been chaotic to say the least, and that's by design. So last week, Todd Beeton took a closer look at a few of Trump's most egregious illegal and unconstitutional acts for The Big Picture.
He’s “so into it” because he has so much to gain, you witless fool.
We’re careening toward a constitutional crisis, where the executive branch may refuse to obey federal court orders to stop their illegal actions with departments and agencies. So what now? Read my write-up: https://buff.ly/3QbkDZx
This is the way.
What a fumble.
Hear, hear!
Best post of the season.
If the White House decides it can defy the will of the courts, then the people must defy the will of the White House.
We’re supposed to just take Elon’s word that he’s found “massive” fraud in federal systems he took over? The same guy they found committing fraud on his fellow gamers?
Great point.
Marbury v Madison is a seminal case from 1803 that holds that the federal courts must determine the constitutionality of the actions of the other two branches of government. Hope that helps, Stephen.
Listen to Secretary Pete. And remember, these are our funds. These are our courts. And these are our streets.
This little boy is a true hero and should be celebrated as such.
The American people aren’t just watching Trump’s second term unfold—they’re pushing back. From lawsuits challenging his overreach to protests in 50 state capitals, this week’s Week In Wins rounds up the ways people are saying ‘not so fast’ to his agenda 👏
Hmmmm...👀
And who determines what the executive’s legitimate power is, JD? The executive?! Come on. 

Let me put it in terms you’d get. It’s like football. The judges are the refs, and they say whether you’re in or out of bounds. And Musk is waaaaaay out of bounds with these takeovers of our systems.
Meghan and Billie teaming up for good 👏

Totally makes sense.

What’s everyone reading to stay in the loop this week? I know exactly where I’m heading for my weekend reads!
Donald would flip his wig if he saw it.
Whoopi 👏👏👏
Are these people for real?
It is so heartwarming to hear from someone so in tune with those around them.
JD Vance was owned hard over his excusing of the anti-Indian racist on DOGE, Marko Elez.
This week’s Just for Skeets and Giggles is out! Have a great weekend. open.substack.com/pub/statusku...
So heartbreaking. 💔
Tell 'em, Brie!
They suck equally hard.
So who is in charge here?
We love it, Will! ❤️
Exactly, Mara! 👏
I mean, why not, right?
This is how it’s done. Dr. Jack Turban is resigning after the NCAA announced it is banning transgender athletes from women’s sports.
Every accusation is a confession.
Best community note ever.
He didn’t get the memo apparently.
I shouldn’t laugh at this but I somehow needed to.
I guess renaming them Swasticars is off the table now.
Of course they think they're the real victims here.
Mexico and Canada just gave a masterclass in handling Trump: let him brag, give him a face-saving win, and walk away having conceded nothing. The Big Picture unpacks how this strategy could keep him in check on the world stage.
But we’re colorblind now.
Yaassss AOC! 👏
Having to fight Elon Musk at DOGE before we’ve even battled Trump feels like having to defeat the forces of Saruman first at Helm’s Deep.
Over the past 17 days, Donald Trump has unleashed a firehose of executive actions designed to overwhelm us, many of which are illegal or unconstitutional. Todd Beeton broke down the most egregious and looked at how Democrats and the courts are taking a stand against them for the Big Picture.
We need to shut ICE down until we can figure out what the hell is going on.
One lie after another.
What was that? 😂😂😂
Maybe he’s afraid he’d find Trump’s PPP tape.
He's not wrong.
How are they going to teach future generations what happened to us? Beyond insane.

Surprising to no one, Trump is yet again being a hypocrite.
I need to report a murder.
That protest vote isn’t working out so well.
I hear this in reggae.
Seems like he's the one who needs a refresher.
It’s been just over two weeks since Donald Trump took the oath of office. And in that time, he has sown more chaos and confusion than even his worst detractors could have expected. Todd Beeton and Jay Kuo dissect the chaos with new pieces this week in The Big Picture.
She’s not wrong. https://xcancel.com/atrupar/status/1886908739610907052
Disgusting yet not surprising from these two.
There’s a big lawsuit everyone should know about. It’s the one that could boot Elon Musk and the DOGE dudes out of Treasury and kill their access to our payment systems. Learn about it in my write-up: https://buff.ly/4jMI4pO
They’re not cheaper by the dozen apparently.
We really are though.
Birds of a feather.
I see what they did there.

You can’t spell FELON without ELON.
And on his own platform! 😂

They have already blown past their own authority. The courts must enjoin them now.
Pretty much how they spin it!
Yes Jasmine! 👏
Now indeed is the time.
Big yikes.
His recent tariff threats against Mexico and Canada were no different, but this time those nations' leaders showed the world how to beat Trump at his own game. thinkbigpicture.substack.com/p/trump-trud...
Trump’s playbook is all too familiar: issue threats, escalate tensions, spark market uncertainty, then backtrack at the last minute and claim victory.
GOP Senator from Kansas even says so.
Measles, mumps and rubella like this post.
A very kind and reassuring gesture.
This is the way they do it in Budapest and Moscow.
Not one thing, nope.
Yaasss!!
I may need to scream.
They shut them down there. Let’s follow them here. Pass it along. https://bsky.app/profile/altusaid.bsky.social
Perfectly put, Melissa.
I may need this on my bumper.
I see more criticism here of Democrats in Congress than I do condemnation of Republicans. 

And yet it is the GOP who are enabling Trump. 

It tells me a lot when I see you regularly bash our side but say nothing, ever, about the other.

Reflect on your choices. You may be helping the fascists.
Can you blame them?
Even Fox? 😂
If the Muscovites want to set up cots at OPM, we should set up human walls.
Resistance to ICE has already begun in my hometown of LA.

It’s a very common question these days in light of all these attacks upon our Republic: Is somebody doing something?! The good news is, they are. I break it down and discuss the four kinds of responses that are happening today. Link in the replies. 
Government officials and leaders: Be like James Dennehy.
Exactly Sully.

Last week wasn’t kind to RFK Jr.—and that’s putting it mildly. Here’s what went down. 👇
It was only a matter of time before he backed the return of Apartheid, especially with Musk whispering in that miraculously healed ear.
This is so disturbing.
Trump/Musk shutting down USAID puts us all at greater risk.

Perfectly captured.
How is Trump hoping to improve air safety?!
Support Canadian alternatives!
This is so heartbreaking.
Not even two weeks into his second term and Donald Trump is predictably causing mass chaos. The good news is Democrats are newly fired up to resist the radical regime of Trump 2.0. The spirit of resistance is alive and well for this Week in Wins. https://thinkbigpicture.substack.com/week-progressiv…
Go Gabby! Ignore the haters and congratulations on your hard work.
It absolutely does.
This is truly disgusting.
This is absolutely not okay.
Dear Canada and Mexico,

We’re so, so sorry.

There’s always something worth reading at The Big Picture. Which piece has stuck with you lately?

We can't wait for this reunion!
Mood.
How did they make such a massive mistake?
@corybooker.com hello I used to run the Wendy’s Twitter account and I am begging you to let me help you with the dems social media strategy, I will literally do it for free at this point
Since tariffs are a tax on U.S. importers, why do we permit the President to impose them unilaterally without authorization from Congress?

Asking for a nation.
I am old enough to remember how the country lost its mind when Bill Clinton removed low level employees in the White House Travel Office.
The drag superstar opened up to late comedian Joan Rivers back in 2013 about how there are "pockets" of time when people are "open"—and predicted a pendulum swing back to the right.
Trump is trying to exploit this tragedy. This upends his narrative.
Resist. Hold the line. Sue.
Oh myyy, they are the very letter of it!
Germans know fascist wannabes when they see them.
They're such hypocrites.
You tell 'em, Pete!
Let me say this clearly. The tariffs are a money grab. Less money in the hands of the American people due to the new 25% tax on goods. More money to distribute to his cronies in the form of tax cuts.

See how it works?
Three of Trump’s most controversial nominees were on Capitol Hill yesterday, and their hearings were anything but smooth. But will that be enough to derail any of them? Maaaaaybe. open.substack.com/pub/statusku...
We don’t have any standards on who we’re putting in charge of our government now. And that’s putting stress on the people already there.
This is what the government did with 120K+ Japanese Americans in 1942.

I know. I was there in those camps.
While it has since been rescinded, Donald Trump's memo freezing federal grants and assistance sent shockwaves across the country this week. In case you missed it, take a look at Jay Kuo's The Big Picture piece exploring this attempt by Trump to strip Congress of spending authority.
So, DOGE. Not DEI.
The real meaning of 'love thy neighbor' 👏👏👏
Bye!
Disqualifying.
He is a callous, soulless man.
Absolutely not.
Time to dig this classic out. Sigh.
We used to all hold our breath hoping a shooter wasn’t a Muslim or a trans person. 

Now we gotta worry if the air traffic controller was Black?! 

Do you see how far they have moved the window?
He makes everything worse.
RFK Jr. has not had a great week. Between two disastrous Senate confirmation hearings and a damning letter from Caroline Kennedy, his path to becoming Trump’s Secretary of Health and Human Services is hardly assured. But can Democrats swing 4 Republicans against him? The Big Picture breaks it down.
They think this is a joke. It’s really really not. https://buff.ly/4hwGjuI
So… Who got the job because of the way she looks or who she knows, and not her qualifications?
After a deadly inflight collision at DCA Wednesday night, Donald Trump tried to blame "diversity" initiatives within the FAA for the crash.
Karoline Leavitt’s only qualification is Trump likes how she looks and lies on TV.
So... who's going to tell her?
I should have known from the handle “Data Republican” that they’d be way wrong.
The tragedy that occurred above D.C. last night is one we must do everything possible to prevent going forward. But our leaders are not only ill-equipped, they are focused on politics as a priority over safety. My write-up: https://buff.ly/4gBasIN
How could you be so cruel?
Enforcing discrimination and hate through economic coercion. Despicable.
Jim Acosta, we are with you.
Isn't it ironic.
Pete Buttigieg responds to Trump’s vicious nonsense.
Their cruelty is matched only by their incompetence.
He really is this dumb.
Bye!
And the gulf is growing wider.
With the terrible tragedy over the skies of D.C., it’s time to prioritize safety. Trump must end the hiring freeze on air traffic controllers and restore the aviation safety advisory committee he dismantled on Jan 22.
Agreed!
Perfectly said.
Musk amplifying the lie that we spent $50 million on condoms for Gaza makes him…a rubber baron.

Thank you, I’m here all week.
I wish I could snap my fingers and get Mike Lee out of the Senate.
How have we even gotten to this point?
Jake Tapper said what everyone was thinking to Stephen Miller as he ranted nonsensically about government spending.
The Democrats’ role is to keep the opposition united and raise public awareness. They can’t block legislation or EOs on their own. They must look ahead to the next election while the GOP governs and likely wreaks havoc.
On Tuesday, Jay Kuo dug into Donald Trump’s OMB memo calling on a freeze of federal grants and assistance before it was ultimately rescinded. And tomorrow, Todd Beeton will break down the craziest moments of RFK Jr.’s confirmation hearings thus far. Don't miss either piece at The Big Picture!
Wowza. The Trump White House has RESCINDED the OMB federal funding freeze. Take that you MFs! 
What are we even doing here?
It’s been a dizzying two days as, in response to public fury, the White House frantically downscaled an across-the-board federal grant and assistance freeze, only to get shut down, for now, by a federal court. Link to my write-up: https://buff.ly/3PWxJKk
Exactly 👏👏👏
Democrats are not going down without a fight. In fact, we’re going to take it all back, bit by bit, because we’re pissed off and motivated as hell.
That didn’t even last a Scaramucci.
Listen to Sen. Kaine. And never Trust Trump on money.
Every time he opens his mouth, it's safe to assume a lie is coming out.
Fox News is reporting this and irony may never recover.
Fail. Big time. Kissing up for access I’ll bet.
This is an agency that works to keep people safe. Not something we need privatized. 🤦
Go Selena 👏
MAGA: This is what you voted for. We tried to warn you.

“But Joe Biden…” is going to be their go-to. Press, don’t let them get away with it.
All around devastating.
In a stunning move, Trump’s Office of Management and Budget has frozen much of federal financial assistance. The consequences could be catastrophic—jeopardizing vulnerable communities and disrupting the economy. The Big Picture breaks down the decision and what’s at stake once it goes into effect.
No. The Medicaid portals were shut down because the OMB demanded they be. They’re only back up because of the outcry. I’d tell you to stop lying but we know that’s a feature of this administration.
These are the people he put in the White House.
What could possibly go wrong?
Narcissists do as narcissists do.
I’d like to see them try and take off my wedding ring.
Banana Republic does what now?
Nope, nope. Absolutely not.
Resistance takes many forms.
Of course.
Preferential hiring for mine, not for thine.
Nailed it.
MAGA loves to complain.
Me, too.
I had to screenshot this.
As we continue to analyze what went wrong in November, it's important to acknowledge that the political media landscape has shifted from TV to digital. In a guest piece for The Big Picture, writer Tristan Snell offered ideas for how Democratic campaigns can succeed in this new media environment.
They are kissing his orange ass so he doesn't put up road blocks to their deals. It’s a shakedown of epic proportions.
This is absolutely disgusting.
Who wants to tell him?
Trump is spending most of his time cozying up to our enemies while picking fights with our closest allies. And that’s a recipe for failure not very far down the road. My write-up in today’s piece: https://buff.ly/42wboKX
This was LBJ’s order of 1965 specifying non-discriminatory practices in federal government hiring and employment.
Perfection.
Winning an election doesn’t mean you get to disregard laws passed by Congress and signed into law by the former president.

Outrageous. Be better, America.
Looks like conservatives don't mind cancel culture when it benefits them.
DEI exists to help right the historic wrong of unqualified white dudes always getting the gig.
This is too, too sweet!
Don't miss this needed edition Week in Wins. https://thinkbigpicture.substack.com/p/week-progressive-wins-january-26 
This past week was a dark one for many of us. It saw the return of Donald Trump to the White House and the targeting of the most vulnerable Americans in a torrent of deplorable executive orders. But there was some light among the darkness.
Apologizing was the right move!
Hoping he and his family can heal.
Clearing his name.
The excitement 😂😂😂
